This is the official rule book for Major League Redditball, 
a game operated by, for, and on the subreddit /r/fakebaseball. 
Reddit users get the chance to take on the role of baseball players 
and executives in a simple game of number-guessing.

The league uses real current and former MLB teams in MLB division format.

Following are the rules to Redditball. 
The overall goal is to keep it relatively simple and accessible, 
while still allowing for flexibility in player and GM strategy, 
statistical variance, and fun!
