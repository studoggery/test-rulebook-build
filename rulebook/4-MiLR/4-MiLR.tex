\subsection{Structure}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
	\item Minor League Redditball (MiLR) is the official minor league affiliate of MLR.
	\item MiLR consists of a single league of an even number of teams.
	\begin{deepEnumerate}
        \item MiLR teams must be affiliated with either 1 or 2 MLR teams.
        \begin{deepEnumerate}
            \item MLR teams who elect to share an MiLR team will be paired randomly by the Office of the Commissioners.
            \item An extra team will be created comprised of MLR GMs and current free agents.
            \item If the extra team makes the number of teams odd, an additional extra team will be created consisting of MiLR GMs and other current free agents.
        \end{deepEnumerate} 
    \end{deepEnumerate}
	\item MiLR games follow the same schedule as MLR games, the only exception being that sessions begin and end one day later than MLR sessions.
    \item The MiLR regular season consists of 14 sessions. 
    \item The league will be split into divisions or leagues as necessary based on the number of teams in MiLR.
    \begin{deepEnumerate}
        \item The MiLR schedule will be determined based on these divisions or leagues.
        \item The playoff structure will be announced prior to the beginning of the season.
    \end{deepEnumerate}
	\item After the 14 game regular season, the top four MiLR teams by record per group will advance to the MiLR playoffs, 
	which consist of a semifinal and final game to be played parallel to sessions 15 and 16 of the MLR regular season.
	\item The MLR teams affiliated with the MiLR champion team each earn a first round protected draft pick in the next MLR Draft 
	unless the GM/Free agent team wins, in which case no picks will be awarded.
\end{deepEnumerate}

\subsection{Team structure}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
	\item Players are not required to play at their known positions in MiLR.
    \item Players playing in a MiLR game may also play in their team's MLR game, but they do not receive the MiLR benefits (see: third position rules).
    \item Each MiLR team must have at least one designated MiLR GM, who will be responsible for creating lineups and acting as the point of contact for umpires.
    \begin{deepEnumerate}
        \item The MiLR GM can be any player on any MLR team affiliated with the MiLR team, including the MLR GM(s).
    \end{deepEnumerate}
    \item If no MiLR lineup is submitted within the first 3 hours of the start of an MiLR session and there is no valid default lineup, 
    the League Operation Managers reserve the right to create a starting lineup in its place.
\end{deepEnumerate}

\subsection{Development Credits}
\label{sec:Development Credits}
\begin{deepEnumerate}
    \item Players participating in MiLR may begin earning Development Credits.

            \item Plate Appearances that result in an Auto K do not qualify.
            \item These methods are not locked by player type. A batter that pitches in MiLR or a pitcher that bats in MiLR are both able to earn credits.

    \item Players will be limited to only making {two} redemptions of any combination in a single season. (Ie. 1 batting type change and 1 position change; or 2 Fielding position changes). This limit resets at the start of a new MLR Season. There is no limit during the offseason.
    \item Players may redeem their credits as outlined by the following table:
